CLOCKWORK PACKAGE 

download chrome clockwork extenstion
run, composer require itsgoingd/clockwork

when you open clockwork extenstion it shows GET / ListingController@index 4ms
i.e get request controller method time

check on database tab it will show
Listing	
Listing	
SELECT * FROM `listings` ORDER BY `created_at` DESC

if you click on laravel on web page, database section of extension will show 
SELECT * FROM `listings` WHERE `tags` like '%laravel%' ORDER BY `created_at` DESC

CREATE LISTING FORM

we'll create a new route, a new controller method and a new view
on route, add 
Route::get('/listings/create', [ListingController::class, 'create']); 

on controller, add 
  public function create() {
        return view('listings.create');
    }

create a new file in views, listings  name it create.blade.php
in the post job button in footer, put the href to be 
href="/listings/create"   i.e the same directory in the route  Route::get('/listings/create')

make sure Route::get('/listings/{listing}', [ListingController::class, 'show']); is below the create one
because when you click on create it will look at the one that is above

go to create.html to paste the form code
paste the selected code 

you have to wrap it in the layouts component for the styles to show which are defined in the layout.blade file
i.e <x-layout> <x/layout>

remove the card div which we already have at card.blade
then wrap x-card /x-card around it too, to display it

read on max width tailwind i.e max-w-lg, it's what makes that card thin and into


VALIDATION AND STORE LISTING
