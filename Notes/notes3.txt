USER REGISTRATION 

we'll start off in out routes web.php
the endoint will be /register, then we'll have a users controller which we don't have yet and the method we'll use will be create, you can call it anyhow eg register, but it's better to stick with the naming conventions
so it will be 
N/B i changed it to register to avoid confusion
Route::get('/register', [UserController::class, 'register']);

then we'll create a new controller with 
php artisan make:controller UserController

then import class 
use App\Http\Controllers\UserController;

then let's go to our layout tochange the link for the register to be a href="/register"
do same for login
a href="/login"
if you click on it it will say create does not exist, so we'll go to our user controller 

make a new fuction to show register form 
public function register() {
        return view('users.register');
}

create a new folder in the views call it users 
then a new file called register.blade

then add the layout component
<x-layout>
    the register page code
</x-layout>
that is why it is good to make the layout a component because it is easy to add it to a new page
then copy the register form html, or you can also copy the one we used for create listing and paste it within the layout

then add the card component we have been using to wrap around the firm i.e card.blade.php 
<x-card class='p-10 max-w-lg mx-auto mt-24'> //here we add unique classes for this form's card
 // the form code
<x-card/>

form action will be /users method will be post, make sure the inputs have a name i.e name="email"

then for validation errors we are going to do like we did in the create listing part, under input: 
 @error('name')
<p class="text-red-500 text-xs mt-1">{{$message}}</p>
 @enderror

 then below at already have an account? change the href to 
 a href="/login"
