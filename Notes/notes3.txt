USER REGISTRATION 

we'll start off in out routes web.php
the endoint will be /register, then we'll have a users controller which we don't have yet and the method we'll use will be create, you can call it anyhow eg register, but it's better to stick with the naming conventions
so it will be 
N/B i changed it to register to avoid confusion
Route::get('/register', [UserController::class, 'register']);

then we'll create a new controller with 
php artisan make:controller UserController

then import class 
use App\Http\Controllers\UserController;

then let's go to our layout tochange the link for the register to be a href="/register"
do same for login
a href="/login"
if you click on it it will say create does not exist, so we'll go to our user controller 

make a new fuction to show register form 
public function register() {
        return view('users.register');
}

create a new folder in the views call it users 
then a new file called register.blade

then add the layout component
<x-layout>
    the register page code
</x-layout>
that is why it is good to make the layout a component because it is easy to add it to a new page
then copy the register form html, or you can also copy the one we used for create listing and paste it within the layout

then add the card component we have been using to wrap around the firm i.e card.blade.php 
<x-card class='p-10 max-w-lg mx-auto mt-24'> //here we add unique classes for this form's card
 // the form code
<x-card/>

form action will be /users method will be post, make sure the inputs have a name i.e name="email"

then for validation errors we are going to do like we did in the create listing part, under input: 
 @error('name')
<p class="text-red-500 text-xs mt-1">{{$message}}</p>
 @enderror

 then below, at already have an account? change the href to 
 a href="/login"


REGISTER USER SUBMISSION
so now we wanna handle the actual submission, we know it's a post request to /users
so lets's handle that in our routes, in web.php make a new route 

Route::post('/users', [UserController::class, 'store']);
//store is our method here, you can name it how you want

we make a new controller, we make it the same way we made storing listing data to stay consistent i.e 
public function store(Request $request)


PASWORD VALIDATION
then we wanna do VALIDATION
for name we wanna have at least 3 characters:
'name' => ['required', 'min:3'],
for email we wanna make it unique and has to email syntax: 
'email' => ['required', 'email', Rule::unique('users', 'email')],

for password because we want the password to be confirmed it's going to be 
['required ,confirmed,']
so what this does it it makes sure to match another field called whatever this fiels is i.e 'password'
remember in our confirm password field we gave it a name='password_confirmation'
you wanna stick to that convention is you want that confirmed
and we also want to give it a minimum of 6 characters, so it becomes 
'password' => ['required ,confirmed, min:6']


HASHING PASSWORD
of course, you wanna hash your password, you never wanna save the password in plain text, we use Bcrypt
all we do is take the form fields, password value, which is the plain text and set it to bcrypt  $formFields['password'] = bcrypt
and pass in that exact field i.e bcrypt($formFields['password'])
so we're just setting it to be the hashed password


now the way that we are going to do this is create the user then automatically log in
we are going to say $user = User:: User is our model and pass in the $formFields i.e 
$user = User::create($formFields);
that will create the user

and then we want to log in, we can do it with the auth helper, and then we can call login and pass in the $user that was created
auth()->login($user);

then we just wanna redirect with succescul message i.e 
return redirect('/')->with('mesage', 'User created and logged in');

we are going to get an error when we press the sign up button, 
so we'll change password validation to 
'password' => 'required|confirmed|min:6'
now it works

Old helper to make data remain after validation error
so we go to register.blade and after name add 
value={{old('name)}} 
note what is in the brackets has to match name i.e value={{old('password_confirmation')}}


AUTH LINKS

We can use a directive called auth because we can wrap anything we want in auth and it will only show ifwe're logged in

copy and paste this part below
  <li>
     <a href="/register" class="hover:text-laravel"
                        ><i class="fa-solid fa-user-plus"></i> Register</a
    >
 </li>
<li>
    <a href="/login" class="hover:text-laravel"
        ><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right-to-bracket"></i>
        Login</a
    >
</li>

now we have 4 <li></li> for the second one change Register to Manage listings, and href to "/listings/manage" which we will do later
then change icon to gear icon

it becomes 
<li>
     <a href="/listings/manage" class="hover:text-laravel"
          ><i class="fa-solid fa-user-plus"></i> Manage Listings</a
     >
</li>

then delete the contents in first li and make a span add auth after welcome
use the auth helper then we can say user, and from this user we can get whatever field we want, lets get the name i.e 
Welcome {{auth()->user()->name}}
now we only want his shown if we're logged in so we'll go above the li and say @auth, then @else after the second li, then @endauth after the 4 LIs, and that's it

so finally, it becomes 

@auth
                <li>
                    <span class="font-bold uppercase">
                        Welcome {{auth()->user()->name}}
                    </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="/listings/manage" class="hover:text-laravel"
                        ><i class="fa-solid fa-gear"></i>
                        Manage Listings</a
                    >
                </li>

                @else
                <li>
                    <a href="/register" class="hover:text-laravel"
                        ><i class="fa-solid fa-user-plus"></i> Register</a
                    >
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="/login" class="hover:text-laravel"
                        ><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right-to-bracket"></i>
                        Login</a
                    >
                </li>
@endauth

when you register you will see Welcome Simon + Manage listings

we need to add a logout link
it's not going to be a link, it's going to be a form because it's going to be a post request
make a new li before @else and a form inside it and then a button

 <form class="inline" method="POST" action="/logout">
 @csrf
    <button type="submit">
         <i class="fa-solid fa-door-closed"></i> Logout
     </button>
 </form>

 now let's go to our routes and handle that, make a route with, give it a method called 'logout'
 make sure it is post, the same with the form we are corresponding to

 Route::post('/logout', [UserController::class, 'logout']);

 now we'll create a logout in the controller

 first off we wanna call auth
 auth()->logout();
 this willl remove the user authentication info from the user's session
 it is recommended that we invalidate the user's session and and regenerate their token, their @csrf token
 so to do that we can say 
 $request->session()->invalidate();
 and regenerate token as well
 $request->session()->regenerate();

 so the user will be logged out, so let's redirect

 return redirect('/')->with('message', 'Logged out');

 so the logout function will look like 

 public function logout(Request $request)
    {
        auth()->logout();

        $request->session()->invalidate();
        $request->session()->regenerate();

        return redirect('/')->with('message', 'You have been logged out!');

    }

If you click logout you will get logged out and notice that the nav links have changed to register and log in
