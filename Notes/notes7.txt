ADD OWNERSHIP TO LISTINGS 

As of now when we submit the form, it doesn't let the database know which user that listing belongs to 

we go to listingcontroller
we just need to add to the database, uder upload image if

and we want a user_id
 $formFields['user_id'] =

and we wanna set that to the user that is currently logged in that's submitting the form so we can use the auth helper
$formFields['user_id'] = auth();

and get the id from that 
$formFields['user_id'] = auth()->id();

and that should do it

register a new account
so create a new listing, check it on the database, the user_id will have been set to 2
which is the id of the user we just created

you can also tinker it 

php artisan tinker

\App\Models\User::find(2)->listings

you will now see that listing from the user there 

exit... to stop tinkering
